I woke to a phone call from my housemate. "I'm at the airport. Where are you?" Shit. I slept through my alarm.

Fortunately there was enough time for breakfast beers.

20 hours later we arrived in Buenos Aires. 

We did a lot of sightseeing and eating over the next few days. We saw:
* La Casa Rosada (the Presidential Palace)
* La Catedral Metropolitana
* Puente de la Mujer (The Tango Bridge)
* And a tango show

The tango show was sick. It had a full band, beautiful singers, a three course meal, and unlimited Argentinian wine. 

We also ate at a steakhouse featured in 'Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown'. But I think it gave Alex food poisoning because he was chundering in the shower that night.
