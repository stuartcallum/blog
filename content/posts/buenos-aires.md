I woke to a phone call from my housemate. "I'm at the airport. Where are you?" Shit. I slept through my alarm.

Fortunately there was enough time for breakfast beers.

20 hours later we arrived in Buenos Aires. Note Angus's bloodshot eyes.

We did a lot of sightseeing and eating over the next few days. We saw:
* La Casa Rosada (the Presidential Palace)
* La Catedral Metropolitana
* Puente de la Mujer (The Tango Bridge)
* The water and sewage museum
* A beautiful bookstore installed in an old theatre
* And a tango show!

The tango show was sick. It had a full band, beautiful singers, a three course meal, and unlimited Argentinian wine. 

We also ate at a steakhouse featured in 'Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown'. But I think it gave Alex food poisoning because he was chundering in the shower that night.

Alex's mate, Chris happened to also be in Buenos Aires with his family. On Christmas Eve, he called round to the AirBnB for a few rounds of Uno.

We wondered the streets for dinner. There was a great buzz. But when we saw McDonalds was closed we knew we were SOL for food. We found a pizza place swarmed with tourists charging $50 for a pizza, and chose to go to bed hungry.

Christmas Day was more festive. We had a wee Kris Kringle with presents we bought in town. And Taaj made us all french toast.

We had a flight to Chile the following afternoon. Angus and I made our pilgrimage to the national football stadium. Football is religion in Argentina. The streets surrounding the stadium are covered in murals. And there's lookalikes of players and coaches to pose for photos with - complete with replicas of the 2022 World Cup.
