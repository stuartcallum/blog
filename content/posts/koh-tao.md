* Choppy water 
* Refused to rent scooter. walked up hill.
* Hostel worker offered me a spliff. french people stormed communial space. panic attack and hid in my bed.
* Walked back to town. Rented my first scooter.
* AJ arrived and brought a storm with him. 
* Got a phone call. AJ locked his keys in his scooter. Had to drive down dodgy dirt road to rescue.
* That night there was a festive atmosphere in the hostel. Perhaps because the French had left.
