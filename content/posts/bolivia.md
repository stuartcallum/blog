# 24hrs in Bolivia
"Right, border's shut. Everyone off." Bloody hell. I'd just gotten to sleep. Looking out the bus's window, I had no clue where we were, but it certainly wasn't La Paz.
"We can *maybe* get you to Copacabana." Images of topical Brazilian beaches flashed into my head. An elderly Bolivian man informed me through a translate app that Copacabana was a tourist town and I'd be able to get to La Paz through there. "I suppose it's one step closer", [Angus](https://www.instagram.com/mullinsangus/) suggested.

I'd heard rummagings of a protest happening in Bolivia. But the protest's extent was far greater than I could imagine.
